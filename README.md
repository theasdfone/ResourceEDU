# ResourceEdu
ResourceEDU is a fullstack application that aims to provide an alternative for file management and storage services for students. ResourceEDU currently operates on local storage but has the necessary framework to support AWS and other cloud databases. Due to the sensitive nature of data, ResourceEDU uses a password encoder to secure passwords in the database and auth tokens to ensure data transactions occur in a secure session.
